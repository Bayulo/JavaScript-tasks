// Which one is generally better, line 1 or line 2?

let empty1 = undefined;
let empty2 = null;

// null assignment is better than undefined assignment. This is becuase
// null means the variable "empty2" does'nt have a value.
// but undefined is mostly used by the system to signify the use of an unassigned variable.
